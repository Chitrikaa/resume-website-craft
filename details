------Core Technologies------
--> HTML5 (HyperText Markup Language)
What it is: The foundation structure of your website
What it does: Creates the skeleton of your webpage - headings, paragraphs, navigation, sections
In your site: Defines all the content sections like Hero, About, Projects, Experience, and Contact
Why it matters: It's the standard markup language that all browsers understand

--> CSS3 (Cascading Style Sheets)
What it is: The styling language that makes your website look beautiful
What it does: Controls colors, fonts, layouts, animations, and responsive design
In your site: Creates the navy blue gradient backgrounds, card hover effects, smooth animations, and mobile responsiveness
Key features used:
CSS Grid & Flexbox: For modern, flexible layouts
CSS Variables: For consistent theming (colors, fonts)
Media Queries: Makes the site work perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops
Animations & Transitions: Smooth hover effects and fade-in animations

  
--> JavaScript (ES6+)
What it is: The programming language that adds interactivity
What it does: Makes your website dynamic and interactive
In your site:
Mobile menu toggle functionality
Smooth scrolling between sections
Dynamic content population (skills and projects)
Scroll-based animations
Active navigation highlighting
Particle background effects

  
------Design Patterns & Architecture------
--> Vanilla JavaScript Approach
What it means: Pure JavaScript without frameworks like React or Vue
Benefits:
Faster loading times
No external dependencies

-->Responsive Design
What it is: Design that adapts to different screen sizes
How it works: Uses CSS media queries to adjust layouts
Result: Perfect experience on phones, tablets, and desktop computers

--> Component-Based Structure
What it means: Code is organized into reusable sections
Examples: Navigation bar, project cards, skill tags
Benefits: Easier to maintain and update specific parts

  
------Performance Optimizations------

CSS Grid: For complex layouts without heavy frameworks
Flexbox: For flexible component arrangements
CSS Custom Properties: For consistent theming
Hardware Acceleration: Using transforms for smooth animations

--> JavaScript Optimizations
